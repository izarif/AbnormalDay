# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 2021-10-09 - 2021-11-10
- Fixed crash the game when playing the demo with parameter cli_bPrediction=1;
- Fixed attempt to create a udp socket when it is already created
  (the created server stopped responding after the first heartbeat)
- added timeout when reading the response to the master server (setsockopt)
- Increased the CTString PrintF buffer 
  (256 bytes was not enough to form a server response on request \status\,
  look.. CTString.cpp)
- Added \basic\ \info\ \rules\ request
- In GameAgent added support for both TFE and TSE
- In DedicatedServer added support for both TFE and TSE
- Restore green color for TFE (it will be right)
- Enabled building DedicatedServer 
- Added few diagnostic messages
- Fixed bug with loading levels from subdirectories (see IsDirectory() function)
- Added support for 16:9, 16:10, 21:9 screen sides. Fixed menu, NETRICSA, font and HUD for all screen ratios. 
  Fixed the position of the weapon and the player's FOV of view from the first and third person 
  for resolutions 16:9 16:10 21:9 (look 42amsterdam.net fix42 open source mod for a classic sam).
- Added MakeFONT compilation to CMakeLists.txt .
  MakeFONT allows you to create your own fonts for the game.
- Added support for launching mods from the game menu. (look CheckModReload function).
- Deleting using time to get a precision timer for __GNU_INLINE_X86_64__.
  Removing the ugly hack /proc/cpuinfo.
  Adding assembler code to get RDTSC for __GNU_INLINE_X86_64__. 
  Adding several libcpuid functions to get the correct TSC.
  (Note: Using a single RDTSC call in 32-bit mode did not take into account the p-state of the processor, 
  the dynamic frequency of the CPU, and led to different game speeds depending on the current p-state.
  Fixed with a function from libcpuid -  look at Engine\Timer.cpp.
  Using time instead of RDTSC In 64 mode broke the menu, 
  dynamic displays of enemy models and weapons in NETRICSA. Fixed by returning RDTSC.)
- Removed SE1_10.gro because it contains broken textures and breaks the localization of the game. 
  (look the waterfall at the level of the oasis and sierra chiapas). A small SE1_10b.gro is left instead
  containing only the textures of the map for changing the levels of the single player game. 
  The rest of the resources are in the original game files.
- Added variables showing the number of monsters killed, as well as ping for a network game.
  (hud_bShowKills hud_bShowPing).
- Added GetMSLegacyPlayerInf(); function to Entities/Player.es for TFE.
- Added "activemod" to the server response to the request \status\ and \info\.
- Added "difficulty" to the server response to the request \status\ and \rules\.
- Added "location" to the server response to the request \basic\.
  (Note: Now we have full gamespy Implementation of the Query 
  and Reporting without "vipplayers" and "password").
- Removed the day of the week in the strftime() function, 
  as it is incorrectly displayed in the Cyrillic locale.
- Added HUD-Options.cfg and NET-PredictionOptions.cfg in Scripts/CustomOptions.
- Fixed mono sound in MixStereo() funcrioin. Now we have strereo sound in 64-bit mode.
  (look my comments in SoundMixer.cpp and SoundMixer386.asm).
- Fixed broken angle calculation with negative epsilon numbers.
  (see https://github.com/Croteam-official/Serious-Engine/pull/49).
- Fixed loading sequence of tech files in mods.
  (look Engine/Base/Unzip.cpp).
- Fixed Freezing the game when restarting the server at the Hatshepsut level.
  (the bug was in Entities/Lightning.es).

## 2022-02-02 - 2022-02-04
- Added crashfixes for libraries Entities and EntitiesMP from the android port.
  (see https://github.com/Skyrimus/Serious-Sam-Android).

- Removed crosshair rendering if the player is dead.

## 2022-05-01 - 2022-05-09
- Fixing sometimes occurring crashes of the game when the player connects to the server.
  (whtn this == null, see Engine/World/World.cpp)
- Added -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks in CMakeLists.txt.
- Added timeout for the connect function when connecting to the master server.
- Added setsockopt for write and read calls when accessing the master server, the socket is switched to non-blocking mode.
- Fixed crash of the game with incorrect cht_iGotoMarker.
- Ð•ngine code excluded from SeriousSam build. Now we have a dynamic libEngine.so library and small SeriousSam,DedicatedServer,MakeFONT files.
  (That's the right thing to do)

- Fixed incorrect variable type in Beast.es.
- Removed deprecated PlatformToolset from aml11lib (Win).
- Fixed Serious Editor 64-bit crash when calling the function to show all entities <N>.
  Now the 64-bit editor has full functionality, just like its 32-bit version.
  The cause of the crash was the conversion of pointers to 32 bits. 
- SeriousModeler: Fixed conversion of pointers to 32 bits (Win).
- SeriousSkaStudio: Fixed conversion of pointers to 32 bits (Win).
- Fixed HUD, player FOV, weapon FOV for Serious Editor.

  Now you can select the fixation method. You can choose to fix the parameters
  of textures that emit a illumination, or a method that creates additional light sources
  that cancel the texture illumination bug.Both methods dynamically edit the world on the
  fly after the level is loaded, before the game starts. Loads/Saves, as well as 
  Demo Recordings (including those made earlier) are now fixded too.
  This fix affects the following levels: "Intro", "Karnak Demo", "Valley Of TheKings",
  "Dunes", "Suburbs", "Metropolis", "Alley Of Sphinxes", "Karnak", "Luxor", "Sacred Yards".
  Other levels do not have this bug.
