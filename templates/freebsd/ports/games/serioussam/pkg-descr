Open source game engine version developed by Croteam for
Serious Sam Classic included First and Second Encounter

Serious Sam: is a high-adrenaline action-arcade shooter heavily
focused on frantic arcade-style single player action. In a world where cyberpunk
meets fantasy-fiction and advanced technology is mixed with black magic
and psycho-powers, Sam travels through the beautiful world of ancient Egypt
and several diverse planets, confronting countless Mental's minions on his way
to the Mental's base.

Playing Serious Sam: The First and Second Encounter still requires Steam or
GOG or CD copy of the game.
This implementation of the source code provides for installation in the system,
in the /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/share directories.

Copy all content of the games Serious Sam Classic First Encounter and
Serious Sam Classic Second Encounter to the appropriate directories:

~/.local/share/Serious-Engine/serioussam/ - for TFE
~/.local/share/Serious-Engine/serioussamse/ - for TSE

They'll be here user data, such as game settings, log, saves, demos.
